Virtual DOM is nothing but an object representation of whole DOM.
React updates the elements on the basis of diff alogrithm.

The update happens by comparing two objects, not the dom.

React is doing efficient DOM manupilation because it has a virtual dom.React can effifciently find out the
difference between virtual doms and update the UI, and this happens with the help of diff algorithm.

cons[res,setRes] = useState(data);

can also be written as follow :

const arr=useState(data);

const res=arr[0];
const setRes=arr[1];
